Homework Problem # 5
Description of Problem (just a 1-2 line summary!): 
Question 5 :
1. Use the same Xtrain and Xtest as before. Train your logistic regression classifier on Xtrain and compute its accuracy for Xtest 
2. summarize your performance measures in the table
3. is your logistic regression better than your simple classifier for any of the measures from the previous table? 
4. is your logistic regression better than your k-NN classifier (using the best k âˆ—) for any of the measures from the previous table? 
5. consider a bill x that contains the last 4 digits of your BUID as feature values. 
What is the class label predicted for this bill x by logistic regression? Is it the same label as predicted by k-NN?
